Create an issue named: 

`Join request: @your_username`

Write in it a brief intro of yourself as well as your Flask experience, the areas you volunteer for from (code, events, education, translation) as well as expounding how you fulfill the criterias above.

Once cleared, you'll be listed on the [launchpad](https://github.com/flaskcwg/join-requests/issues/1) until you get involved!
